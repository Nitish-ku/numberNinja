        area of rectangle : $$length\times bredth$$
area of the rectangle 1 : $$5\times 10 = 50m^2$$
area of the rectangle 2 : $$2\times  7 = 14m^2$$
sum of the area of the rectangle 1 and rectangle 2 : $$50m^2+14m^2=64m^2$$
so, the total area of the rectangle : $$64m^2$$
let length of the unknown rectangle be x
let bredth of the unknown rectangle be y
area of the unknown rectangle = $$x\times y$$
now, $$x\times y=64$$
To find the dimension of the unknown rectangle we can find various pairs of length and bredth such that $$length\times bredth=64m^2$$
Some possible dimension could be :
$$1) L = 16m, W = 4m$$ 
$$2) L = 32m, W = 2m$$
